## Welcome to my GitHub ðŸ—¿

I am Hugo Negrel, a passionate engineer freshly graduated from [ENSTA Paris](https://www.ensta-paris.fr/) and [Mathematics Vision Learning (MVA)](https://www.master-mva.com/) master's program. I specialized in Applied Mathematics/Computer Science during my student years, and more particularly, I had the chance to follow state-of-the-art courses on both machine learning and numerical analysis of PDEs at respectively MVA and [Analysis, Modeling, Simulation](https://uma.ensta-paris.fr/modsim/) master's program. I am also passionate of physics in general, especially in astrophysics ðŸŒ• and plasma physics. 

I am currently actively seeking for exciting opportunities in the field of Machine Learning and numerical analysis, whether it is for a CIFRE PhD thesis or directly in an industrial job, so if you happen to be interested by my profile, let me know!
