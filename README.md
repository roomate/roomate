## Welcome to my GitHub 

I am Hugo Negrel, a passionate engineer freshly graduated from [ENSTA Paris](https://www.ensta-paris.fr/) and [Mathematics Vision Learning (MVA)](https://www.master-mva.com/) master's program. I specialized in Applied Mathematics/Computer Science during my student years, and more particularly, I had the chance to follow state-of-the-art courses on both machine learning and numerical analysis of PDEs at respectively MVA and [Analysis, Modeling, Simulation](https://uma.ensta-paris.fr/modsim/) master's program. I have great interest in the art of exploiting theorems of functional analysis to build innovating and efficient numerical methods, like Finite Element methods and its (Galerkin) discontinuous counterpart... I am also passionate of physics in general, especially in astrophysics ðŸŒ• and plasma physics.

Not a line of my projects was 'vibe-coded'.

I am currently an AI Research Intern at Capital Fund Management in Paris.
